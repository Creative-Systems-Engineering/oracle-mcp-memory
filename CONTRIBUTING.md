This project started with the philosophy: **"I have no idea what I'm doing..."** and evolved through collaborative iteration. We believe the best innovations come from admitting we don't know everything and working together to find solutions!

### 🌟 Project Origins
- **Problem Identification**: Real developer frustration with AI context loss
- **Collaborative Development**: Human vision + AI implementation assistance
- **Community Building**: Open source approach to help all developers

Thank you for helping make AI memory better for everyone! 🚀
